The code is based on the methodology developed by Leung et al, "A proposed complete methodology to predict gravity flow obstruction of pharmaceutical 
powders in drug product manufacturing." Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 108.1 (2019): 464-475.
The purpose of this code is to evaluate the risks involved in gravity-driven flow of pharmaceutical powders in EXISTING hoppers, including mass flow/funnel 
pattern, arch formation under active stress (filling, initial discharging) and passive state (emptying) and rathole formation.
