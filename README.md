(1) The code is based on the methodology developed by Leung et al, "A proposed complete methodology to predict gravity flow obstruction of pharmaceutical 
powders in drug product manufacturing." Journal of pharmaceutical sciences 108.1 (2019): 464-475. However, some of the equations in "Dietmar Schulze, 
The prediction of initial stresses in hoppers, Bulk Solids Handling, 1994, 14, 497-503" are also used.

(2) Remember that Jenike method is very conservative for the estimation of arch diameter. It is even more conservative
for the prediction of rathole diameter! If Jenike method says that a system doesn't rathole, it will definitely will NOT rathole!
-----
(3) If the hopper outlet is not fully activated (as in most tablet presses), Jenike method is even not directionally correct!!
-----
(4) The purpose of this code is to evaluate the risks involved in gravity-driven flow of pharmaceutical powders in EXISTING hoppers, including mass flow/funnel 
pattern, arch formation under active stress (filling, initial discharging) and passive state (emptying) and rathole formation.
